# Yelp Business Data to ElasticSearch
Mapping of Yelp's Business Data to Elastic Search with Geo-sharding. 

### Motivation

This entire project is inspired from this Tech talk: [Evolution of ElasticSearch at Yelp](https://speakerdeck.com/elastic/the-evolution-of-elastic-search-at-yelp). A few slides towards the end, the talk highlights some of the future activities that will be done at Yelp using ElasticSearch. One of which is moving of Business data to ElasticSearch, and support better Geo-sharding. This project is my attempt to move business data meticulously on ElasticSearch cluster, and visualize it. 

### Dataset
Yelp's Business Dataset is obtained from Yelp's Dataset Challenge at [this](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) link. Due to the mammothness of the dataset, this repository contains only a miniscule version of the original file.
